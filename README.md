# racer-ws

This is a plugin to use racer over a websocket connection.

## Usage

In the server part of your app:

```js
var racerWS = require('racer-ws'); 

// ...
// var server = http.createServer
// ...

// ...
// var store  = racer.createStore 
// or
// var store  = derby.createStore
// ...

var upgrade = racerWS(store);

// ...

server.on('upgrade', upgrade)
```

If you use `racer-ws` with derby make sure `racerWS(store)` is before any calls to `app.writeScripts`.
